## About Me

I received my bachelor's degree in Mechanical Engineering from the City College of New York. While I was studying there, in 2018, I joined Professor Jing Fanâ€™s research on producing multilayered flow-focusing microcapillary devices with three other students for a year. We were designing a novel device that could encapsulate microscopic droplets with larger different-component droplets, which could potentially be used to create multilayered medical capsules that dissolve at a specific rate within the body, creating timed, multi-drug treatments. After months of designing and iterating, we found the optimal design and filed a US Provisional Patent Application in 2019 under Professor Jing Fan. 

After receiving my bachelor's degree, I got accepted into Columbia University Bridge to CS MS program, and started to explore the beauty of computer science. After one year of study, I will enter the MS portion in Fall 2022 with an expected graduation of Dec 2023. I am particularly interested in the fileds of software engineering, database management and data science.

Besides interest in STEM fields, I also love music. I studied violin & viola in the Juilliard Pre-college while I was in high school, and became principal violist of the pre-college symphony later. I was also accepted into the New York Youth Symphony and ended up performing many times in Carnegie Hall, both solo and with the NYYS. I also have been teaching violin in a private music school in weekends for many years, and many of my students have received high scores in New York State School Music Association festivals/Exams.
