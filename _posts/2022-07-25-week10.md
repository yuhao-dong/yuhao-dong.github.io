title: Week 10
---

This week is the last week of our DREAM program, so for the first two days, I helped my teammate to implemented another type of D3.js graphs, heatmap. We successfully created a customized heatmap that could show different colors which indicate different rates. We also displayed the actual number in each grid. After we finished implementing the heatmap, I started to write very detailed comments in my code explaining what does my code do. I explained what is each variable, function, and component, what are they used for, and how can we make change on them. I also wrote a detailed documentation on how to use the components I wrote for the graphs, and how can they add their own graphs. I explained what are the parameters we need to pass in for each graph, and how to insert the components into our web app. I explained my documentation in our group meeting as well, so people who would join our team later will be very easy to pick up my progress and continue building more features if they want.
